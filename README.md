# CS-340-Client-Server-Development
This repository contains my final dashboard code and README from Project Two, integrating a CRUD Python module with MongoDB for Grazioso Salvare.

Code Maintainability
I wrote modular, well-documented, and reusable code to ensure easy integration. The CRUD module from Project One streamlined database operations in Project Two and can be reused in future projects requiring MongoDB interactions.

Problem-Solving Approach
I translated client requirements into a functional system by designing a structured database, efficient CRUD operations, and an interactive dashboard. Compared to past assignments, this project involved real-world scalability and data management strategies.

Impact of Computer Science
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by building efficient systems. This project helps Grazioso Salvare manage animal records effectively, improving decision-making and operational efficiency.
